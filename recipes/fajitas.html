            Arrachera or inside skirt is 
            normally one of the preferred 
            beef cuts for high end tacos. 
            It has the right amount of fat
             and a great meat taste that 
             few cuts can rival. If you 
             want to eat it like a Mexican, 
             try to make an "arriera" sauce 
             to garnish - chop 5 jalapeno 
             peppers, 1/2 onion and a bunch 
             of cilantro. Combine all and 
             add the juice of 2 limes and 
             the same amount of olive oil finally add 3 bulbs garlic. 
             Salt to taste and let marinate for as long as possible.</p>
